What to do next?
1. output classical registers (what to output? just output global variables or let user to specify output)
2. implement more ISA instructions (mainly cmp)
3. add FOR loop IR generation
4. add more operators to BINARY2IR (bit operations, assignment operations), UNARY2IR
5. JMP: break, continue
6. initializers

Thoughts: 
could carry and tmp be reused? No, comparison need a sub operation, where sub_ex(a, b, tmp, carry) is used.
